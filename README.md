# Gwfa evaluation scripts

This repo contains the scripts to generate the graphs and queries used in the evaluation of Gwfa. They requires [pggb](https://github.com/pangenome/pggb), [minigraph](https://github.com/lh3/minigraph), [bedtools](https://github.com/arq5x/bedtools2), and [minimap2](https://github.com/lh3/minimap2) to run. 

Besides, this repo also provides the scripts to evalute the performance of Gwfa and other sequence-to-graph alignment tools.
